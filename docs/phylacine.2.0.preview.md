Get ready for the next generation of PHYLACINE, with exciting new updates that expand the dataset and refine its capabilities:

- **Updated Taxonomy**: Incorporating the latest species classifications (IUCN 2020-2).
- **New Backbone Phylogeny**: Improved phylogenetic tree with enhanced and open extinct species integration.
- **Updated Traits and Ranges**: Bringing even more accuracy to species data.
- **Expanded Range Maps**: Sligtly modified projection, and now covering species distributions down to Antarctica.
- **Extinct in Prehistory (EP) Species updates**: Adding and changing more extinct species in the database.

[Read more about the tentative details of the update here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G3UZQWU6VO3lSG1Ncz39TcOx26Gw2Avm/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103468066651678713884&rtpof=true&sd=true).

While PHYLACINE 2.0 brings valuable new tools and data for researchers, we are happy to let you know we are already planning version 3.0 - which will introduce even more exciting features, including increased map resolution, historical and future species ranges, and expanded trait data like density and metabolic rates!
